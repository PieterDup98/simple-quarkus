# simple-quarkus
Simple Quarkus App for Capgemini Spring MIG:
1. Simple Rest API
2. Integration with H2 database

Also look at [simple-springBoot](https://github.com/PieterDup98/simple-springBoot) as that repo does exactly the same, but is build with Spring Boot.

## Good to know:

With Quarkus, there is no need to create an Application class. Itâ€™s supported, but not required.

Run Quarkus in development mode:
```shell
mvn quarkus:dev
```
This enables live reload with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect.
When running in this mode you can access for a cool Developer UI http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui

Run jar with:
```shell
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```
