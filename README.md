Simple Quarkus App for Spring MIG Demo


## Interesting findings:

With Quarkus, there is no need to create an Application class. Itâ€™s supported, but not required.

mvn quarkus:dev runs Quarkus in development mode. 
This enables live reload with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect.
When running in this mode you can access for a cool Developer UI http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui

run jar with java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
